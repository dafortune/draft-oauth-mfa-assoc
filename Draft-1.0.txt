              OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authenticator Binding
                     draft-hanson-oauth-mfa-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines mechanisms for dynamically binding
   authenticators with authorization servers.  Once bound, an
   authenticator can be used for strong authorization within OAuth 2.0.

Internet-DraftOAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authenticator Binding     July 2017


1.  Introduction

   In order for an OAuth 2.0 authorization server to enforce strong
   authorization, it must associate resource owners with one or more
   authenticators capable of responding to a strong authorization
   challenge.  This specification describes how an authenticator can be
   dynamically bound with an authorization server to obtain this
   information.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification also defines the following terms:

   MFA Token:

      A short-lived token representing an authorization session.

2.  Protocol Endpoints

   The authenticator binding process utilizes two authorization server
   endpoints (HTTP resources):

   o  Associate endpoint - used by the client to obtain parameters
      needed to bind an authenticator to an authorization server.

   o  Bind endpoint - used by the client to bind an authenticator to an
      authorization server.

2.1.  Associate Endpoint

   The associate endpoint is used by the client to obtain parameters
   needed to bind an authenticator to an authorization server.

2.1.1.  Associate Request

   The client makes a request to the associate endpoint by sending the
   following parameters with a content type of "application/json":

   mfa_token
         REQUIRED.  The MFA token received from the authorization
         server.

   authenticator_types
         OPTIONAL.  Array of authenticator type strings that the client
         supports.  These authenticator types are defined as follows:

         *  "otp": A device that generates one-time passwords.

         *  "oob": A device that communicates securely with the
            authorization server over a secondary channel.

         Authorization servers MAY allow for other values as defined in
         the authenticator type extension process.

   oob_channels
         OPTIONAL.  Array of out-of-band channel strings that the client
         supports.  These out-of-band channels are defined as follows:

         *  "sms": SMS channel to the user at a registered number.

         *  "tel": Telephone call to the user at a registered number.

         *  "email": E-mail sent to the user at a registered address.

         *  "auth0": Push notification to Guardian app on user's mobile
            device.

         *  "duo": Push notification to Duo Mobile app on user's mobile
            device.

         Authorization servers MAY allow for other values as defined in
         the out-of-band channel extension process.

   client_id
         REQUIRED, if the client is not authenticating with the
         authorization server as described in Section 3.2.1 of
         [RFC6749].

   If the client was issued client credentials (or assigned other
   authentication requirements), the client MUST authenticate with the
   authorization server as described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6749].

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request (line
   breaks are for display purposes only)::

   POST /associate HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "authenticator_types": [
       "otp", "oob"
     ]
   }

   The authorization server MUST:

   o  require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
      client that was issued client credentials (or with other
      authentication requirements),

   o  authenticate the client if client authentication is included,

   o  ensure the MFA token was issued to the authenticated confidential
      client, or if the client is public, ensure the MFA token was
      issued to "client_id" in the request,

   o  verify that the MFA token is valid, and

   o  restore the authorization session based on the claims in the MFA
      token.

2.1.2.  Associate Response

   If the associate request is valid and authorized, the authorization
   server selects an authenticator that the client is capable of
   supporting, and responds with an HTTP 200 OK status code and a body
   of type "application/json" with the following content:

   authenticator_type
         REQUIRED.  Authenticator type to associate with the user's
         account.

   bind_code
         REQUIRED.  Bind code generated by the authorization server,
         used to complete binding of the authenticator to the user's
         account.  The bind code MUST expire shortly after it is issued
         to mitigate the risk of leaks.  A maximum bind code lifetime of
         10 minutes is RECOMMENDED.

   barcode_uri
         OPTIONAL.  URI to be rendered as a barcode which can be scanned
         by the authenticator to effect provisioning.

   The response MAY include additional parameters that are interpreted
   according to an authenticator type definition.
